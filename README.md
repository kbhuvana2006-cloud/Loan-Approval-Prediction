# Loan Approval Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts whether a loan will be **Approved** or **Not Approved**
using Machine Learning in Python.

---

## 📌 Objective
To automate the loan approval process based on applicant details such as
income, education, credit history, and property area.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Random Forest Classifier
- GitHub

---

## 📂 Files in this Project
- `loan_prediction_input.py` – User input based loan prediction
- `loan_prediction_accuracy_98.py` – High accuracy model
- `dataset.csv` – Loan dataset
- `README.md` – Project documentation

## 🚀 Algorithm Used
**Random Forest Classifier**

### Why Random Forest?
- High accuracy
- Reduces overfitting
- Works well for classification problems

---

## 🎯 High Accuracy Model
- File: `loan_prediction_accuracy_98.py`
- Algorithm: Random Forest
- Accuracy: **Up to 98%**

This model uses optimized parameters to achieve better prediction accuracy.
